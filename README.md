# Temper Cloudwatch Integration

This software provides a cronjob to publish temperature as CloudWatch metrics.

It also also provides a bash script to set up CloudWatch alarms. These alarms notify whenever the temperature drops below a certain threshold.

This code is a wrapper to Pham Urwen's temper software (https://github.com/urwen/temper).
